# Security Measures for Key Network Protocols and Services

---

## 1. FTP (vsftpd)

* **Disable anonymous access** unless absolutely necessary.
* Use **chroot jail** (`chroot_local_user=YES`) to restrict users to their home directories.
* Limit passive FTP port range and configure firewall accordingly to minimize attack surface.
* Enable **logging** (`xferlog_enable=YES`) and monitor for suspicious activity.
* Use **FTPS (FTP over TLS/SSL)** or **SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)** instead of plain FTP to encrypt data and credentials.
* Regularly update vsftpd and underlying OS to patch vulnerabilities.
* Restrict FTP user access with user lists (`userlist_enable`, `userlist_file`).
* Use strong, unique passwords for FTP users.
* Disable unnecessary FTP commands (e.g., anonymous upload, delete) if not required.

---

## 2. Web Servers (Apache HTTP Server)

* Use **HTTPS** by enabling `mod_ssl` and obtaining valid SSL certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt).
* Keep Apache and all modules up-to-date.
* Disable directory listings (`Options -Indexes`).
* Use **firewalls** and **WAFs (Web Application Firewalls)** like `mod_security`.
* Limit access with IP-based restrictions or authentication where needed.
* Harden HTTP headers (e.g., `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`).
* Restrict and audit CGI scripts or other dynamic content for security risks.
* Monitor logs for intrusion attempts and unusual traffic patterns.
* Disable unnecessary modules to reduce attack surface.

---

## 3. Telnet and SSH

* **Avoid Telnet** over untrusted networks — use **SSH** instead for encrypted access.
* For SSH:

  * Disable root login (`PermitRootLogin no`).
  * Use **key-based authentication** instead of passwords.
  * Disable password authentication if possible (`PasswordAuthentication no`).
  * Change default SSH port from 22 to reduce automated attacks (optional).
  * Use **fail2ban** or similar tools to block IPs with repeated failures.
  * Limit SSH access to specific users or IPs (`AllowUsers`, `AllowGroups`).
  * Regularly monitor SSH logs (`/var/log/auth.log`).
  * Keep SSH server and client software updated.
  * Use strong passphrases and protect private keys.

---

## 4. VPN (OpenVPN, IPsec, PPTP, L2TP)

* Use **strong encryption algorithms** (AES-256 preferred).
* Use **certificates and keys** with proper management for authentication; avoid weak pre-shared keys if possible.
* Regularly update VPN software and underlying OS.
* Enforce strict access control on VPN endpoints.
* Monitor VPN connection logs for unusual activity.
* Use secure protocols: avoid PPTP due to known vulnerabilities; prefer OpenVPN or IPsec.
* Apply firewall rules to restrict VPN traffic only to necessary ports/protocols.
* Use strong user authentication methods (multi-factor authentication if possible).
* Implement network segmentation behind VPN to limit exposure.
* Secure key exchange mechanisms (e.g., Diffie-Hellman groups with sufficient strength).

---

## 5. LDAP (OpenLDAP)

* Use **LDAPS** (LDAP over SSL/TLS) to encrypt directory communications.
* Enforce **access control lists (ACLs)** to restrict who can read/write sensitive directory entries.
* Use strong passwords and consider account lockout policies.
* Restrict LDAP binding to trusted clients or networks.
* Regularly audit LDAP access and modify logs.
* Backup LDAP data regularly.
* Keep OpenLDAP and system packages up-to-date.
* Validate schema changes carefully before applying.
* Use separate administrative accounts for LDAP management.
* Monitor for brute-force or injection attacks against LDAP.

# Security Measures for STP, VLAN, and VTP

---

## 1. **Security Measures for STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)**

* **Enable BPDU Guard:**
  Protects the network from rogue switches by disabling ports that receive unexpected Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs), typically on access ports connected to end devices.

* **Enable Root Guard:**
  Prevents switches from becoming root bridge unless explicitly authorized; protects network topology stability.

* **Enable Loop Guard:**
  Detects and blocks ports that stop receiving BPDUs unexpectedly, avoiding loops caused by unidirectional link failures.

* **Use PortFast on access ports only:**
  Avoid enabling PortFast on switch-to-switch links to prevent accidental topology changes.

* **Limit STP bridge priority settings:**
  Manually assign root bridge priority to trusted switches only to control topology.

* **Monitor STP status regularly:**
  Use commands like `show spanning-tree` to detect unexpected topology changes.

---

## 2. **Security Measures for VLANs**

* **Use Private VLANs (PVLANs):**
  Isolate devices within the same VLAN to prevent lateral movement or sniffing among hosts.

* **Disable unused switch ports or place them in an unused VLAN:**
  Prevent unauthorized devices from connecting.

* **Implement VLAN Access Control Lists (VACLs):**
  Control which traffic is allowed within or between VLANs.

* **Use VLAN pruning:**
  Limit VLAN traffic on trunk links to only VLANs that need to traverse those links, reducing unnecessary exposure.

* **Avoid using VLAN 1 for user traffic:**
  VLAN 1 is default and often used for management; isolate sensitive traffic.

* **Secure trunk ports:**
  Use allowed VLAN lists on trunks, and disable dynamic trunking protocol (DTP) where not needed to prevent rogue trunk formation.

* **Authenticate users/devices before VLAN assignment:**
  Use 802.1X for network access control tied with VLAN assignment.

---

## 3. **Security Measures for VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)**

* **Use VTP Passwords:**
  Prevent unauthorized devices from sending VTP updates that can modify VLAN configurations.

* **Limit VTP Server Roles:**
  Only a few trusted switches should operate as VTP servers to reduce risk of accidental or malicious VLAN changes.

* **Use VTP Transparent Mode on Edge or Non-Server Switches:**
  Prevent unintentional VLAN overwrites by making switches ignore VTP updates.

* **Monitor VTP Revision Numbers:**
  Avoid connecting switches with higher revision numbers that can overwrite VLAN databases.

* **Use VTP version 3:**
  Provides enhanced security features including support for extended VLANs and protection mechanisms against accidental VLAN deletions.

* **Physically secure switch ports:**
  Prevent unauthorized devices from connecting and sending rogue VTP messages.

# Security Measures for ACL, DNS, NFS, and Samba

---

## 1. **Access Control Lists (ACL)**

* **Use explicit deny rules before permit rules** to block known threats precisely.
* **Always include a final deny all rule** to prevent unintended access (implicit deny is default, but explicit is safer).
* **Apply ACLs inbound whenever possible** to filter traffic before it consumes router resources.
* **Use named ACLs** for easier management and clarity.
* **Limit ACL scope** to necessary interfaces and directions (inbound/outbound).
* **Regularly audit and update ACLs** to remove obsolete or overly permissive rules.
* **Test ACLs in a staging environment** before production deployment.
* **Combine ACLs with other security tools** like firewalls and intrusion detection systems for layered defense.

---

## 2. **Domain Name System (DNS)**

* **Implement DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)** to ensure authenticity and integrity of DNS data.
* **Restrict zone transfers** to authorized secondary servers only.
* **Limit recursive queries** on authoritative servers to prevent DNS amplification attacks.
* **Run DNS servers with minimal privileges** and keep software up to date.
* **Monitor DNS logs for unusual query patterns** that may indicate attacks.
* **Use access controls and firewall rules** to restrict who can query or manage DNS servers.
* **Deploy redundant DNS servers** geographically to improve availability and resilience.
* **Separate internal and external DNS zones** to protect internal network details.

---

## 3. **Network File System (NFS)**

* **Limit NFS exports** to trusted IP addresses or subnets only.
* **Use Kerberos authentication** (SECURITY=krb5) to encrypt and authenticate NFS traffic.
* **Avoid using NFSv2 and v3 over untrusted networks; prefer NFSv4** which supports better security and firewall friendliness.
* **Run NFS services with minimal privileges** and in chroot or containerized environments if possible.
* **Regularly update NFS server and client software** to patch vulnerabilities.
* **Disable root squashing only if absolutely necessary**; otherwise, prevent root access from clients.
* **Use firewalls to restrict NFS ports (2049 and related RPC ports).**
* **Monitor NFS logs for unauthorized or suspicious access attempts.**

---

## 4. **Samba (SMB Server)**

* **Disable SMBv1 protocol** to mitigate EternalBlue and similar vulnerabilities.
* **Enable SMB signing and encryption** where supported to protect data in transit.
* **Use strong passwords and enforce password policies** for Samba users.
* **Limit share permissions using both Samba and underlying filesystem ACLs.**
* **Restrict Samba shares to specific IP ranges or VLANs via firewall or Samba config.**
* **Regularly update Samba server software** to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Enable logging and audit Samba access for anomaly detection.**
* **Use Samba in Active Directory mode if possible, to leverage domain security features.**
* **Avoid sharing sensitive directories unless absolutely necessary; use read-only shares if appropriate.**
